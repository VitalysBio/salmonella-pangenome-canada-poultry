## IQ-TREE phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic inference was performed using IQ-TREE v3.0.1 based on the
core genome alignment generated by Panaroo. The analysis was conducted
to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the selected
*Salmonella enterica* genomes.

### Software

IQ-TREE version 3.0.1 was used for phylogenetic reconstruction.

### Input data

The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the filtered core gene
alignment generated by Panaroo.


### Phylogenetic inference parameters

IQ-TREE was executed with the following parameters:
- Model selection: ModelFinder Plus (`-m MFP`)
- Ultrafast bootstrap replicates: 1000 (`-B 1000`)
- SH-aLRT support: 1000 replicates (`--alrt 1000`)
- Automatic thread selection (`-T AUTO`)

### Output

These outputs include the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree,
branch support values, and associated model selection and log files,
which were used for downstream visualization and interpretation.

### Reproducibility note

The script used to execute IQ-TREE is provided in this repository for
documentation and reproducibility purposes. The phylogenetic results
included in this project were generated prior to publication and do not
require re-execution unless the user intends to regenerate the tree from
the original Panaroo alignment.
