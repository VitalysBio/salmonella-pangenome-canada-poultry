## Panaroo pangenome analysis

Pangenome analysis was performed using Panaroo v1.5.2 with Biopython v1.78. Panaroo was applied to the genome annotations generated by Prokka in order to identify core and accessory gene clusters across all genomes included in the study.

### Software environment

Panaroo was executed in a environment with the following versions:
- Panaroo v1.5.2
- Biopython v1.78

### Input data

Panaroo was run using GFF files generated by Prokka. These files were collected from the Prokka output directories and copied into a new folder prior to pangenome analysis.

### Output
These outputs include gene presence–absence matrices, pangenome summary statistics, and core gene alignments used for downstream phylogenetic and comparative analyses.

### Reproducibility note

The script used to execute Panaroo is provided in this repository for documentation and reproducibility purposes. The pangenome results included in this project were generated prior to publication and do not require re-execution unless the user intends to regenerate the pangenome from the original Prokka annotations.
