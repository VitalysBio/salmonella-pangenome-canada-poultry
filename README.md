# Salmonella pangenome from Canadian poultry

This project is an integrated genomic analysis of Salmonella enterica serovars Enteritidis and Heidelberg isolated from Canadian poultry. The study combines pangenome reconstruction, phylogenetic inference, and functional annotation to characterize core and accessory gene dynamics. This approach provides deeper insight into the evolutionary structure and adaptive strategies of these serovars within poultry production systems.
