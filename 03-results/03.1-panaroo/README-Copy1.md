### Pangenome summary statistics

The Panaroo run resulted in the following pangenome composition after
quality filtering and clustering:

- **Filtered core genome**: 3728 out of 4000 genes retained
- **Core genes** (99% ≤ strains ≤ 100%): 4000
- **Soft core genes** (95% ≤ strains < 99%): 13
- **Shell genes** (15% ≤ strains < 95%): 843
- **Cloud genes** (0% ≤ strains < 15%): 228
- **Total gene clusters** (0% ≤ strains ≤ 100%): 5084


### Panaroo key outputs

This directory contains the essential output files from the pangenome
analysis performed using Panaroo. Only files that are directly required
to reproduce downstream analyses and figures are retained.

### Included files

core_gene_alignment_filtered.aln

Filtered core genome multiple sequence alignment generated by Panaroo.
This alignment was constructed using genes present in at least 99% of
genomes and was used as the direct input for phylogenetic inference
with IQ-TREE.

---

gene_presence_absence.csv

Gene presence–absence matrix generated by Panaroo. Rows correspond to
gene clusters, and columns correspond to individual genomes. This file
was used for pangenome characterization, comparative analyses between
sequence types, and visualization of gene presence–absence patterns.


### Notes on reproducibility

All other intermediate or large Panaroo outputs were intentionally
excluded from this repository to maintain a lightweight and readable
project structure.
