## Genome FASTA files are not stored in this repository.

All genomes used in the analyses can be retrieved using the information
provided in `genomes_manifest.tsv`. Genome assemblies originate from
either NCBI RefSeq (GCF accessions) or EnteroBase assemblies.

FASTA files must be renamed using the following convention:
<region>_<name>_<accession_no>.fasta
